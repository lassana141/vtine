	<h2 style="color: white;">Hey bae,</h2>
	<p>I was lost in this world when you came in. From the very moment we became couple I felt complete. Expressing my Love to you gonna take a whole week. You are the woman that I think about whenever I wake up. In life, love is never planned, nor does it happen for a reason. But when love is real, it becomes your plan for life and reason for living and You are the reason I live everyday.</p>
